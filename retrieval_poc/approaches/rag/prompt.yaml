  You are tasked with converting receipt information from JSON format into a natural language search sentence. This search sentence will be used by an automated expense management system to find the appropriate company expense approval rule for the receipt.

  Here is the receipt information you need to analyze:

  <receipt_json>
  {{RECEIPT_JSON}}
  </receipt_json>

  Your goal is to create a search sentence that captures the key aspects of this expense so it can be matched against the company's expense approval rules. These rules can cover any type of business expense - there are no predetermined categories, so you must reason about the expense type directly from the JSON data.

  Company expense approval rules typically include factors such as:
  - Expense type (meals, travel, equipment, conference fees, transportation, office supplies, etc.)
  - Amount ranges and thresholds
  - Geographic scope (domestic vs international)
  - Participant requirements (business guests, company members only, etc.)
  - Specific restrictions or requirements
  - Tax considerations

  Instructions:
  1. Carefully examine all fields in the receipt JSON including merchant name, amount, date, description, category, location, and any other available information
  2. Determine what type of business expense this represents based on the available data
  3. Identify key characteristics that would be relevant for matching approval rules (amount, location, purpose, participants, etc.)
  4. Consider what approval rule factors would apply to this type of expense
  5. Create a natural language search sentence that includes the most important details for finding the right approval rule

  Before providing your final answer, work through your reasoning process in <expense_analysis> tags. It's OK for this section to be quite long. Consider:
  - Extract and list the key fields from the JSON data (merchant name, amount, date, location, description, category, participants, etc.)
  - Based on this data, what type of business expense does this represent?
  - What are the most important characteristics for approval rule matching (amount threshold, geographic considerations, participant types, etc.)?
  - What specific terms and details should be included in the search sentence to find the most relevant approval rules?

  Provide your final search sentence in the format below. The sentence should be clear, specific, and include the most relevant details for identifying the appropriate expense approval rule.

  Example output structure:
  <expense_analysis>
  Key fields from JSON:
  - Merchant: "Italian Bistro"
  - Amount: $85.50
  - Attendees: 3 people including one external client
  - Category: Restaurant/dining

  Expense type: This appears to be a business meal expense with external participants.

  Key characteristics for approval rules:
  - Amount: $85.50 (falls into mid-range meal expense category)
  - Participant type: External client present (may require special approval)
  - Location: Restaurant setting
  - Purpose: Client meeting/business dining
  </expense_analysis>

  <search_sentence>
  Business dining expense for client meeting at restaurant with external attendees, amount $85.50
  </search_sentence>
