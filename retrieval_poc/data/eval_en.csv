① Gift certificates, such as Amazon gift certificates
② Gift catalogs
③ Other items that are easily convertible into cash (※1)
④ High-value items (※2)

※1 Regarding determining whether a cash equivalent is ""highly convertible"":
Items that can be converted into cash at gift certificate shops are considered cash equivalents.
Items that can be converted into cash at gift certificate shops have a market price, and both ""ease of conversion"" and ""conversion rate"" are high, which means they are considered highly convertible.
Disney tickets and Starbucks gift cards also qualify as cash equivalents.

※2 While there is no clear standard for the amount, you must also consider the overall balance when making a decision.
(Example) If the maximum value of the prize to be distributed is ¥30,000
If only a portion of the total participants receive a prize, it is not subject to payroll tax.
If 40 out of 50 people receive a prize worth ¥30,000, it is subject to payroll tax.
